course='Python for beginners'
print(len(course)) #give the number of how many word are used
print(course.upper()) #all the cases are in capital later
print(course.lower()) #all the case are in small later
print(course.find('f')) #the index number of the later f
print(course.find('x')) #the output is -1 because there is no X in the strings\
print(course.find('beginners')) #the output will be 11 because biggnners starts with 11 index
print(course.replace('beginners','absolute beginners')) #replate a word or many word with the new input
print('Python' in course) #its a bool expression(true or false)





#len is a function but upper/and all are the method of strings. here is the difference
